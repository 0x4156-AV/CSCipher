# CSCipher
A program that can determine and solve the type of encryption used on a string of encoded text.
This was created with Capture The Flag competitions in mind and solves algoithms mainly used there, not modern ciphers.
This program will be written entirely in Python and will later be transformed into Bash to be included in [aaronstoolkit](www.github.com/Aaronvigal.com/aaronstoolkit).
Created by [Aaron Vigal] (www.aaronvigal.com) on Saturday, July 23rd, 2016 for Millard West High School.
